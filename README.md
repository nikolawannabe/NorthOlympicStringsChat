# Proposal: North Olympic Strings Chat

# What
I imagine North Olympic Strings Chat to be a group chat with multiple channels for people who are involved in string music on the North Olympic Peninsula.

# Rules
1. Time is a gift.  Every message and every reply should be treated with kindness and respect for those who gift their time.
2. No money.  This chat does not allow people to request or accept funds. Please do that elsewhere.
3. No big decisions.  No one in this chat with knowledge that is needed should be assumed to be able to respond quickly or should be pressured to respond because of the gravity or consequences of the request.  This is a good place to talk about general ideas, brainstorm, and come together.  When you think you might be ready to make a big decision, please take it to another forum such as email or in person. 

# Who
Here are some people who might benefit from this chat:
- Board members or social media managers of string organizations on the peninsula such as Port Angeles Symphony Orchestra, Sequim Community Orchestra, Olympic Strings, Orchestra Parents United for Students, Music on the Straights, Monday Musicale, and others I haven't thought of may benefit from collaborating and coordinating with other string organizations, conducting parent outreach, providing accurate information about your programs to musicians and students, etc.
- String student (or for children, their parents): join if you want to learn about opportunities to learn an instrument or orchestra skills anywhere on the Peninsula.  This includes students who have some education but would like to participate more as well as students who have never played an instrument.  Adult and child students are welcome.
- Adult string musicians: join if you want to join to talk about playing with orchestras, chamber groups, small groups like quartets.
- Private lesson teachers: join if you want to find students, or if you want to tell parents you're full up!
- Public school teachers: join if you want to talk to any of the above, for example, if you'd like to find a private teacher for one of your students, or if you'd like to reference them to an appropriate after school program to grow their skills, scholarships for lessons, etc.

# Why
1. The Olympic Peninsula has a very vibrant orchestra community with many different groups all attempting to find program participants, funding, and administrative help.
2. We are busy. Everyone from the public school teachers, adult string musicians, board members, and parents are very busy and finding time to meet up and plan (and knowing who to do it with) is often difficult or impossible.
3. We all want to work together for similar goals, but sometimes don't know enough to do that well.

# How
